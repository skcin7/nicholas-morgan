        <h1>Writings</h1>

        <p>Basically sometimes I have some streams of consciousness about certain topics and for whatever reason I decide to record said streams of consciousness in writing/words, and sometimes I publish some of them here. It's mostly just me incoherently babbling/rambling on my part, with very little actual of this so-called "content", though I've heard there is actually _some_ content here too buried underneath all the fluff, but you're gonna have to look really hard to find it. I can't say I would recommend reading ANY of this, and you should probably <a href="https://www.oprah.com">leave now</a> before it's too late (for your own good)! ðŸ˜€ Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
